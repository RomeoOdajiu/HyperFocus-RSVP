# Privacy Policy for HyperFocus
**Last Updated:** January 2026

**HyperFocus** ("the Extension") is a browser extension designed to help users read faster using the RSVP method.

## 1. Data Collection
HyperFocus **does not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information or user data. The Extension operates entirely locally within your browser. We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools.

## 2. Data Usage
* **Web Page Content:** The Extension accesses the text of the web pages you visit solely to process it and display it in the RSVP reader overlay. This processing happens locally on your device (DOM manipulation). No content is ever sent to external servers.
* **Settings:** User preferences (such as theme, font, and reading speed) are stored locally using the Chrome Storage API to persist your settings across sessions.

## 3. Permissions Justification
* **"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit":** This permission is required exclusively to enable the RSVP reader to function on any article or page the user chooses to read.

## 4. Contact
